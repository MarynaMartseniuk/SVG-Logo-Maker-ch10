## Description
### Motivation to create this App was a wish to have a simple LOGO creator so that I can easy add a little personality to my projects in a way to adding this LOGO.
### I built this App because it had some new coding challanges needed to be solved. For me, as for a begginer, it was importent to get a new skills and got understanding that "I can do it!".
### This App hepls a user create a simple personal LOGO just in two minutes. It is an easy, simple and fun that can show your personality!
### This project was interesting and usefull for me because, as a begginer, I learned what SVF-file is, how to create SVG-file. I learned how to write tests and use a jest library.
